Working with some real smart dudes to learn Git, API's and a bit of Ï€thon.

1. Just Created my first repository after creating my account. I'm told to write a read-me, one of these documents I've never actually read so I can keep track of my ideas and progress.
2. Next, I'll need to share this repository with all my friends, I think I did that.
3. Next I created a slack account b/c I use teams at work. Here is the handy dany link to join my workspace: https://join.slack.com/t/slack-ieo7624/shared_invite/zt-y567yq40-PmpTEtjjIbY1QZmdpGSrNg
4. Then I downloaded Ubnt using powershell via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I'll need to reboot now.
